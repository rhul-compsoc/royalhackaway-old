short-description: "A great place to start if you're interested in hacking."
full-description: "Some of you lot have never written a line of code, and others of you spend your weekends writing C for fun (you're insane). A coding event that suits everyone sounds impossible, right? Think again. We'll have pizzas, games and a CTF style coding challenge for everyone who wants to get involved. There'll be prizes for the quickest team to finish!"
