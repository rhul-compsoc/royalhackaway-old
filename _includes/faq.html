                <h3 class="text-center">What's a hackathon?</h3>
                <p>
                    A hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build &and; share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. You don’t have to be a programmer and you certainly don’t have to be majoring in Computer Science.

                <h3 class="text-center">Do you do travel reimbursements?</h3>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we don't have the sponsorship to cover this :(
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Who can attend?</h3>
                <p>
                    Any student currently enrolled on a university degree programme can attend. Unfortunately, due to insurance requirements, we won&#x27;t be able to accept under 18s this year.

                <h3 class="text-center">How much does it cost?</h3>
                <p>
                    0, nothing, null, void. Royal Hackaway is free to attend with everything provided by our super sponsors!
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-center">What's the deal with food?</h3>
                <p>
                    We'll provide you with food across the weekend free of charge. Please make sure you let us know of any dietry requirements.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Can I stay overnight?</h3>
                <p>
                    You'll be able to work overnight in the venue. You might want to bring stuff like sleeping bags and we will have a relaxation area for you to crash out.

            <div class="col-sm-4 inner-left-sm inner-top-sm">
                <h3 class="text-center">Who owns my project?</h3>
                <p>
                    You and your team! We, and our sponsors, don't claim any rights to your IP - you are free to do as you wish with it. It would be cool if you put your code on an online repository, like <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> but you are under no obligation to do so.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Can I start before I arrive?</h3>
                <p>
                    While you can explore ideas, you cannot write a line of code for your project before the event itself.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-center">What shall I bring?</h3>
                <p>
                    Bring your laptop, charger(s) and any other devices you wish to work on at the hackathon. If you are staying overnight, you will also need to bring toiletries, and a sleeping bag or blanket and pillow.
